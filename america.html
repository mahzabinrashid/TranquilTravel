      <h1>Chicago Deep Dish Pizza</h1>
      <p>Chicago is famous for its unique style of making pizza. The crust is very deep, creating a very thick pizza that resembles a pie. The dough is pressed up onto the sides of the pan, forming a bowl for a very thick layer of toppings.The crust is covered with cheese and topped with pepperoni or sausage, onions, mushrooms, and bell peppers. The finishing layer is a tomato sauce, with Parmesan cheese sprinkled over it for some extra flavour. </p>

       <h1>Texas Barbecue</h1>
      <p>Each region of Texas has its own version of Texas barbecue. In East Texas, the meat is cooked over hickory wood and marinated in a sweet, tomato-based sauce. In Central Texas, the meat is rubbed with salt and black pepper, then cooked over indirect heat from pecan, oak, or mesquite wood. In West Texas, the meat is cooked over direct heat from mesquite wood in a method very similar to grilling. Last but certainly not least, in South Texas, the meat is marinated in thick, molasses-like sauces that keep the meat moist after cooking. You pick your favourite!</p></article>

       <h1>Apple Pie</h1>
      <p> The saying is "American as apple pie" for a reason: this sweet treat is a national institution. The simple combination of sugar, buttery pastry and tart sliced apples produces a dessert so extraordinary people have devoted their entire lives to perfecting it. For a particularly excellent example, try the apple pie with added green chilies at the Pie-O-Neer, in Pie Town, New Mexico. Phone ahead and Kathy Knapp, the self-proclaimed "Pie Lady of Pie Town", will save you a slice.</p> </article>
